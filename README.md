Here’s a fresh, professional GitHub “About Me” section that smoothly bridges your past as a web developer with your current focus on cybersecurity — while keeping your strong React/frontend identity intact:

## About Me
Former Frontend Developer & UI/UX specialist turned cybersecurity learner. I spent years crafting pixel-perfect, accessible interfaces with React and modern JavaScript — now I’m channeling that same attention to detail into understanding how to protect the systems we build.

- 🔭 **Currently learning**: Cybersecurity fundamentals, ethical hacking, web application security, penetration testing, and secure development practices  
- 🌱 Applying my React & frontend expertise to hunt for vulnerabilities in modern SPAs, misconfigured auth flows, XSS, CSRF, and supply-chain attacks  
- 💼 **Past life**: Frontend Developer · UI/UX Designer · Design Systems · Component Architecture  
- 🛠️ **Core stack**: React · TypeScript · Next.js · Tailwind CSS · Node.js · Vite  
- 🔒 **Security toolkit (growing)**: Burp Suite · OWASP ZAP · Nmap · Wireshark · Kali Linux · secure coding patterns  

> “Great UIs deserve great security.”  
> Turning my love for clean code and delightful user experiences into a mission to make the web safer — one component (and one vulnerability) at a time.

⚡ Fun fact: I still refactor components in my sleep… now I just dream about rate-limiting and CSP headers too.

Let’s connect if you’re into React, secure frontends, bug bounties, or just beautiful code!

This version:
- Keeps your strong React/frontend branding (so recruiters still find you)
- Clearly signals your career pivot into cybersecurity
- Shows how your existing skills are an asset in security (huge differentiator!)
- Remains professional yet personable
- Works perfectly as a GitHub README or profile bio

Just copy-paste and update the banner path if needed. Happy hacking (ethically)! 🚀
